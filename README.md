# Email-extractor-filter
The email extractor and filter script is easy to use, just clone the repository into your development environment or just download the two PHP files and inject it into your project.

The app is easy to use, simply use your preferred email manager (it is recommended to use Outlook), export the trays or folders from which you want to extract the data and extract the information in Excel .csv format (delimited by commas), Upload the file to the form and submit.

Once you send it, the script will create a copy of the file and will give you two formats of the filtering that was carried out, you can find the filtered information in:

db_emails/txt/today's date/clear_emails_today's date.txt
db_emails/csv/today's date/clear_emails_today's date.csv

And ready :)
